# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, fuel type, city, and year of manufacture. Leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically regression modeling, the goal is to develop accurate predictive models that provide valuable insights into the pricing dynamics of pre-owned vehicles.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains information about used cars, including attributes such as:
- Car name
- Car price (in rupees)
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- City
- Year of manufacture

## Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained machine learning models.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Exploration of dataset characteristics, distribution, and relationships between variables.
   - Visualizations including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and more to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
   - Creation of new features such as 'car_age' to capture relevant information.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Training various regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using cross-validation techniques.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessment of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Holdout validation and testing on unseen data to ensure model generalization.

## Conclusion
Through comprehensive exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, this project provides valuable insights into the pricing dynamics of used cars. The predictive models developed offer accurate estimations of car prices, empowering stakeholders with actionable intelligence for informed decision-making in the used car market.
